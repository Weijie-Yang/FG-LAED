### Instructions for Importing a New Conda Environment

#### 1. Create a New Environment

To import a new Conda environment, ensure you have a YAML file (e.g., environment.yml) that defines the required packages and versions.

*Command:**

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create a new environment based on the settings in the yml file.

#### 2. Modify Environment Name

If you want to change the name of the new environment, you can add or modify the name field at the beginning of the yml file. This means defining the new environment's name on the first line of the yml file. For example:

```yaml
name: my_new_environment  # Here, the name of the new environment is specified.
dependencies:
  - numpy
  - pandas
```

Or specify a new name directly via the command line:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml --name new_environment_name
```

#### 3. Resolving Version Conflicts

If you encounter version conflicts during the installation process, follow these steps:

- **Check the error message**：Conda will provide detailed information about the conflict.
- **Force installation of specific versions**：Specify the required package versions in the yml file. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  - numpy=1.21  # Specify the NumPy version
```

- **Manually install conflicting packages**：If the yml file import fails, you can first create the environment, then manually install the required packages and specify the environment version.

```bash
conda create --name my_new_environment
conda activate my_new_environment
conda install numpy  # According to the versions specified in the yml file.
```

By following these steps, you can successfully import a new Conda environment and resolve version conflict issues.
